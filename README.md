# Efficiency mode for all applications
app that sets all programs to Efficiency mode except the ones in exceptions.
Works with windows 11 and windows 10
In windows 10 there is no efficiency mode in task manager but the backend works the same
In windows 11 you can see the apps which are being optimalized and apps which are left alone

In case you accidently put an app into efficiency mod that was meant to be on performance just restart the app or the computer. Everything will be back to normal
